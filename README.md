# Air Pollution Analysis
The data analysis for the air-pollution-dataset repository.

## Description
The Air Pollution Data Analytics project aims to analyze air pollution data over several years, focusing on emissions of nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxides, carbon dioxide (CO2), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), measured in tonnes per year. The project will also incorporate data on air pollution-related death rates. The dataset covers all countries from the 1970s to the present. The analysis will provide insights into the trends, patterns, and impact of air pollution on a global scale.

## Objectives
Identify countries with significant air pollutant emissions and high death-rates related to air pollution.

Explore the historical trends of nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, CO2, and VOC emissions across all countries over time.

Investigate the correlation between air pollutant emissions and air pollution-related death rates across all countries over time.

Provide visualizations and data-driven insights evaluating global trends in air pollution and its possible effects.
